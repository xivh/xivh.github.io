    <h1>Blind for Disrupt the District</h1>
    <p>I used Python to perform natural language processing and regex on a pdf resume. When names or phone numbers were matched,
      they were removed from the resume. This project won 4th place at Disrupt the District and a finalist spot for the UVA Entrepreneurship
      Cup Concept Competition. (<a href="https://github.com/notzane/ResumeBias" target="_blank">Github</a>)</p>

    <h1>Google Cloud and NCAA Machine Learning Competition</h1>
    <p>I used Python to do machine learning on a data set of NCAA teams. After cleaning the data in Excel, I did my best to create a model
      using scikit-learn. I succesfully predicted many of the first round games, including UVA's historic loss, but my model wasn't that good
      in the later rounds... (<a href="https://github.com/xivh/March-Madness-ML-2018" target="_blank">Github</a>)</p>

    <h1>SYS2048</h1>
    <p>I worked with a partner to build an automated greenhouse. Features included automatic heating and watering, passive cooling, control from the web, and data stored
      on AWS. I used C++ to run the greenhouse from an Arduino and PHP/MySQL for remote control.</p>

    <h1>SYS3048</h1>
    <p>I worked with a group to make a prototype of <a href="https://www.eongroup.co/circularid" target="_blank">Circular ID</a>. Our prototype consisted of three parts:
      an RFID scanner connected to a Particle Photon, a Flutter app, and a database on AWS. I used PHP/MySQL to store product information, receive and record scans from
      the Photon, and communicate scans and product information to the app.

    <h1>StyleGAN2</h1>
    <p>I trained StyleGAN2 to make pictures of fruit and other things. One of the fruit networks is on <a href="https://archive.org/details/network-snapshot-004223" target="_blank">archive.org</a>.
      I used V100 GPUs on UVA's Rivanna cluster and TPUs on Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud. The TPUs were hard to use, so I made some <a href="https://github.com/xivh/stylegan2-colab-notebooks" target="_blank">Colab notebooks</a>
      to help out.

    <h1>AMR Capstone</h1>
    <p>I did my capstone in the Autonomous Mobile Robots lab at UVA. We created a robot path planning framework for autonomous navigation in uncertain environments. I used
       Keras to predict safe speeds and traversability given friction, turn angle, and incline. We presented our work at IEEE SIEDS 2021 and the paper is available as part 
       of my <a href=https://doi.org/10.18130/s82f-3r41 target="_blank">thesis at the UVA Library</a>.
